This application was built for the fire alarm company Signature Building Systems(SBS).  Preventative Maintenance Agreements (PMA)
are bi-annual checks of client fire alarm systems.  These are mandated by NY State law and the business was having problems keeping
track of clients and when to schedule etc.. This application really helped organize the PMA manager and is still in use by the company. 
The application also allows inspectors to remotely log their daily work.
